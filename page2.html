In the presence of a truly beautiful object, a secret instinct alerts us of its value and we are forced to admire it in despite of prejudgements or initial aversion. This consensus of people of good taste proves that all men know love, hate, and all the passions of that kind, if they can be intoxicated with the same pleasures and torn by the same pains, moved equally in the presence of beauty, as they also feel hurt by the sight of ugly, that is imperfection.
